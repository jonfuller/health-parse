# Apple Health Parse

This project parses Apple Health Data and outputs it in Excel format for analysis.

## Local Tests

You can test the project locally using the HealthParse project.

To load the data open program.cs and replace the string "REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_IMPORT_ZIP" with the location of your exported Apple Health zip file.

To export the data to the correct location replace "REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_EXPORT_LOCATION" with the export location you'd like the file saved to.
